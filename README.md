**ITU Prefix Library**

This library allows you to take a callsign and get the country the prefix is assigned to.




**How to use**

Sample code is located in `test.go`.

To run it, first install [Go](http://golang.org/) then cd into the ITU-Prefix directory.
Then run `go run *.go`

If everything went well you should see that all 5 tests passed.




**License**

`test.go` is in the public domain but the PrefixLookup package is licensed under the MIT License
